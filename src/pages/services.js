	<p>WordPress is a platform that over 40% of all websites are built on. It is the most popular content management system in the world.</p>
	<p>WordPress allows for a website to be made relatively quick, has many templates to choose from, and can be fully customized. It's a good option for small to medium-sized businesses or personal websites. </p>
	<p>Typical WordPress Design Cost Range: $1,500 - $5,000.
	<br/><em className="subFont">*Prices vary depending on the size of the project.</em></p>

	<p><img src={ReactLogo} alt="React Logo" /></p>
	<p>React is used by over 1.8 million websites and is one of the most beloved web frameworks by developers.</p>
	<p>A React website does take a significant amount of more time to create and maintain than a WordPress website but the overall performance of a React website is superior. React websites typically load faster which is important for things like SEO and a users experience. React websites are more custom and extremely scalable, making it a good choice for anything from small to large websites. This website that you are on now is built with React.</p>
	<p>Typical React Website Design Cost Range: $10,000 - $100,000.
